        <h2>React Time</h2>
        <p>
            There comes a point in any developers life where they decide, "Yolo, let's put react in my application".
            Nowadays, there are a MILLION templates that will allow you to spin up a react project that "just works",
            but I think most of them are difficult to work with. So let's spin up our own, because it's pretty easy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember, React is just another file type that we will need to <b>transpile</b>. Lucky for us, babel-loader
            comes with a react preset, so we can just use that.
            <code>
                <pre>

    const path = require('path');

    module.exports = {
    entry: './index.js',
    output: {
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
        filename: 'bundle.js',
    },
    mode: 'production',
    module: {
            rules: [
                {
                    test:/\.(js|jsx)$/,
                    include: path.resolve('./'),
                    loader: 'babel-loader',
                    options: {
                        presets: ['babel-preset-env', '@babel/preset-react']
                    },
                    exclude: /node_modules/
                }
            ]
        }
    }
                </pre>
            </code>
            Note that we exclude the node_modules for good measure, or else we will accidentally try and bundle them too.
