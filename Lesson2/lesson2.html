            Now that we know how to bundle our files, lets take a look at the <b>transpiling</b> side of things
            When it comes to transpiling, webpack has two main concepts that you have to know: <b>loaders</b> and <b>plugins</b>.
            We will talk about plugins in the next page.
        </p>

        <h2>Loaders</h2>
        <p>
            Loaders allow you to preprocess ANY file type and output something else in turn. There are many loaders out there
            and you can even write one yourself if you want, it's not that hard. The loader that we are going to look at now
            is called <i>babel-loader</i>. This is a popular loader, because it is able to transpile bleeding-edge JavaScript
            to any ECMAScript Standard that you like, such that you are compatible across all browsers, even those from the late
            2000s.
        </p>
        <p>
            We add the babel-loader in our webpack-config like so:
            <pre>
<code>
    const path = require('path');
    module.exports = {
    entry: './index.js',
    output: {
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
        filename: 'bundle.js',
    },
    mode: 'production',
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.js$/,
                include: path.resolve('./'),
                loader: 'babel-loader',
                options: {
                    presets: ['babel-preset-env']
                }
            }
        ]
    }
    }</code>
            </pre>

            Note that "babel-preset-env" is a smart parameter that you can pass to babel so that you can always use cutting
            edge JavaScript. if we didn't pass this preset, we would have to specify the version that we're writing in and
            the version that we are targeting explicitly.
