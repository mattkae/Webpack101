        <h3>
            The ECMAScript Standard
        </h3>
    
        <p>
            A big part of what your browser does is nowadays is process JavaScript. JavaScript itself
            is just an implementation of the <b>ECMAScript Standard</b>. Your browser vendor has to
            implement this standard (in their own way) in order to be compliant. (See the Standard
            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/Js/js_versions.asp">here</a>.)
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Now, let's say that you're favorite browser fails to implement some shiny new feature from
            the shiny new ES2019 that you really really want to use. Of course you could yolo use it anyway,
            but that might break many of your users.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            To remedy this, people started using things called <b>transpilers</b>. Transpilers are able to take
            JavaScript written in your shiny new syntax, and <b>transpile</b> it into JavaScript that is
            compatible with a browser that does not yet support your shiny new syntax.
        </p>

        <p>
            The cousin of the <b>transpiler</b> is the <b>bundler</b>. The bundler takes all of the transpiled files
            that you've imported and squeezes them all into one file, so that it's easy for your browser to consume.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Webpack</b> is a bundler. <b>Babel</b> is a transpiler.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Even more shiny new thing
        </h3>
        <p>
            On top of wanting shiny new things that exist in the ECMAScript standard, JavaScript people also want
            shiny new things that do not exist at all! This is where TypeScript, React, SCSS, etc. come in. These
            syntaxes are NOT supported in the ECMAScript standard. Hence, we create a bunch of <b>transpilers</b>
            to convert their code into vanilla JavaScript, and then we simply bundle them.
