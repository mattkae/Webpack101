        <h2>TypeScript</h2>
        <p>
            At some point in your development, you will want to write in TypeScript.
            Luckily, we know that TypeScript is just another file format, and our webpack configuration
            can easily handle it.
        </p>
        <p>
            First, we'll need the types for react, so let's do the following:
            <code>

            <pre>

    npm install --save-dev @types/react @types/react-dom
            </pre>
            </code>

            This way, TypeScript can resolve types for React.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, let's install our TypeScript loader in webpack. We will use ts-loader. To use it, we also need
            to have typescript installed (typescript provides us with the "tsc" command that can turn any JavaScript
            file into a JavaScript file; ts-loader uses this "tsc" command internally).
            <pre>

    npm install --save-dev ts-loader typescript.
            </pre>
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, we tell webpack how to resolve files with a .ts or .tsx extension like so:
            <pre>
    
    ...
    {
        test:/\.(ts|tsx)$/,
        include: path.resolve('./'),
        loader: 'ts-loader',
        exclude: /node_modules/
    }
    ...
            </pre>
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, we add a tsconfig.json to the top-level of our project, next to our webpack.config.js. I will not
            get super deep into this configuration file, but do know that it is what your tsc command (and ts-loader internally)
            uses to process your TypeScript files. It is infinitely configurable, but that is a talk for another day.
